Here are some most important chrome extensions I use almost on a daily basis. All of them can be installed on chromium browsers. But, they may not be available on Firefox or other browsers. 

## [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/)
[Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) is the first thing I install on every browser. It saves all my passwords on all my devices. I rather not depend on Google to save my passwords since It limits my options to just use same-old Chrome. 

But, I want to have my options and I have at minimum 3 browsers installed on every system (Brave, Edge, Chrome, Firefox). 

## [Accept All Cookies](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/accept-all-cookies/ofpnikijgfhlmmjlpkfaifhhdonchhoi)
Cookies are literally a pain for me. This extension takes care of all cookies and just ignores. I literally don't care about whether cookies are stored or what not. I just want to browse the web without me confirming that I allow my information to be stored. 

> Note: I don't disagree with GDPR rule and I think it is best if websites choose not to save any cookie and don't ask me any time I want to enter their site. 

## [Picture-in-Picture Extension (by Google)](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/picture-in-picture-extens/hkgfoiooedgoejojocmhlaklaeopbecg)
This extension is good when I want to have a video stick around with me while doing something repetitive. 

> Google says: Picture-in-Picture (PiP) allows you to watch videos in a floating window (always on top of other windows) so you can keep an eye on what you’re watching while interacting with other sites, or applications.

## [AdGuard AdBlocker](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/adguard-adblocker/bgnkhhnnamicmpeenaelnjfhikgbkllg)
This one simple blocks adds. 

## [Anti Adblock Detector](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/anti-adblock-detector/kjhdffcfinhkdfbbhjlfoadcdfgihmlp)
This one is interesting. It helps to block adds on those sites which have a way of detecting add-blockers! 

## [The Great Suspender (notrack)](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/the-great-suspender-notra/ahkbmjhfoplmfkpncgoedjgkajkehcgo)
As you know, Chrome eats RAM. A lot of it. 

This helps to suspend the tabs which are not used for sometime in order to eat less RAM. 

## [Google Keep Chrome Extension - Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/lpcaedmchfhocbbapmcbpinfpgnhiddi)

I think we all need some application to store content to be consumed later. It can be youtube videos or blog posts or whatever. Some people like to use applications like `instapaper` or `omnivore` but I just want to keep things simple as I already use google keep a lot. 

More importantly, I like to keep my life as simple and minimalistic as possible. 

## [Dastyar Personal Assistant in your newtab](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/dastyar-personal-assistan/ebilacdhmebcihmbjgibcbeaihbecapj?hl=fa)
This extension is for Iranian people like me who like to see their local calendar and date and time everytime they open a new tab in browser. 

## [Proxy SwitchyOmega](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/proxy-switchyomega/padekgcemlokbadohgkifijomclgjgif)
I also use this extension to selectively pass some website into a tunnel. 

## [magnolia1234 / Bypass Paywalls Chrome Clean · GitLab](https://gitlab.com/magnolia1234/bypass-paywalls-chrome-clean/)
This one passes some paywall sites. 

## [RSS Reader Extension (by Inoreader)](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/rss-reader-extension-by-i/kfimphpokifbjgmjflanmfeppcjimgah)


## [Pie Adblock: Block ads, get paid.](https://pie.org/)

## [Tabrr New Tab - Dashboard with Sync](https://tabrr.com/)

## [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/)
