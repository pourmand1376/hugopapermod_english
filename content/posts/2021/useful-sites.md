These are primarily bookmarks I have in my browser. I thought they could be helpful to others, so I have compiled them here. 

## For Researchers


[Connected Papers](http://connectedpapers.com "Connected Papers")

This is an excellent tool for researchers, especially when searching for review articles. Enter the paper title, and you'll be able to see a beautiful graph of connected papers, as the name suggests!

[Research Rabbit](https://researchrabbitapp.com/)

I have always wanted a tool to find related papers to the ones I am already reading. This one does that. So, you don't need to search for the state of the art papers using different keywords now and then.

[Find Conferences, Journals, Workshops, Meetings, Symposiums, Seminars](https://www.resurchify.com/)

This one find important events as the name suggests. This is a must know for researcher who want to submit their papers and attend on conferences and workshops and etc. 

[Paper Digest](https://www.paper-digest.com/)

This site digests papers for you and writes a good summary for them. 

[MathPix](https://mathpix.com/)

This powerful program converts math formulas in Image or PDF to Latex.


[Online Mathematics Editor](https://www.mathcha.io/)

A fast way to write and share mathematics, especially when you don't have access to LATEX. Also, whenever I need to write some formulas, I first come here and write them, then export them into LATEX. It is a lot easier.

[Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid-live-editor/) - [Mermaid Live](https://mermaid.live/)

The best tool (language) for drawing a diagram is Mermaid. You don't have to use a mouse anymore. Just describe what you want, and it will render a beautiful diagram. This is also supported in GitHub markdown.

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/)

Also, when creating more complex layouts that can not be defined easily via Mermaid, I have this one in mind. 

[Journal and Conference Ranking](https://www.resurchify.com/)


## Text Editing and paraphrasing tools

[Grammarly](grammarly.com)

Who doesn't know about Grammarly? It has become a de facto standard when checking grammar. However, what it does is very simple. Often I find it boring since It can not rephrase the whole sentence. I had an educational premium account, but I don't use it anymore. 

[WordTune](https://www.wordtune.com/)

It paraphrases my sentences into better ones, and I found this one very intelligent too.

[QuillBot](https://quillbot.com/)

This one is pretty interesting too. It offers unlimited free paraphrasing, so I use this one more than Wordtune.

[Real-time codesharing platform](https://codeshare.io/)

Here I can share my code in real-time! This is also good as a clipboard-sharing platform!
